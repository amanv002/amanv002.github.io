        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! I'm Anastasia Manvelyan. I'm a third year history major here at UCR. I still don't know what my specialization will be, but I love learning about different periods in history. After graduation I hope to get my Master's Degree in History and then get my teaching certification, and possible get a Master's Degree in Education.Another route I see for myself is becoming a substitute teacher while getting my Masterâ€™s Degree in history to make money on the side.<br><br>

        I recently got laid off after having worked at a drugstore for almost two years. Those two years have provided me with a lot of insight into the world of customer service, specifically in retail. It was a fun job that involved being very active. There was always something to do such as stocking shelves, running the cash register, and so much more. This job taught me how to socialize with people better, how to be patient, and how to navigate difficult situations with problematic customers. It wasnâ€™t the most rewarding job, because what job in retail is rewarding, but it was a good first job to get my feet wet in how Corporations treat their employees, especially if you work in retail. It was a good environment with friendly co-workers and overall a good job for a college kid.<br><br>

       Before that I was tutoring at my old elementary school. It was a good experience for me because it made me realize I donâ€™t like to work with children. Theyâ€™re too rowdy, and can't sit still. But it wasnâ€™t that bad of an experience to be able to talk to little kids and help them with their homework.For two summers in high school I worked at an insurance office, which was a nice gig for a high school kid and I had something to do during the summer. It allowed me to expand my knowledge when it came to office equipment and the inner workings of a small office. I enjoyed sorting documents, calling customers, organizing the filing cabinet, shredding files, and calling insurance companies. <br><br>
      My job experience might not be extensive, but Iâ€™ve learned many things from each place that I have worked, adding them to my list of skills and knowledge that I have acquired. Currently, as someone who is unemployed, itâ€™s difficult to be doing nothing. Most of my days were filled with going to work and then doing homework and being occupied. Being laid off was a blessing and curse, obviously it sucks, but it has started to make me think about what Iâ€™m going to do in the future. Iâ€™ve been putting off thinking about life after college because it feels like such a daunting task to think about your future and what youâ€™re going to do. However, if I want to succeed at adulting, I have to dwell on these matters now that I have all the time in the world. <br><br>
